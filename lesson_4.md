# intro to sensors

####Overview
Students will learn to incorporate sensors onto their sumo robots. 

####Learning Goals
By the end of the lesson, students will be able to
* write conditionals
* identify ultrasonic sensor
* identify color sensor
* write code utilizing sensors

####Introduce Concept

#####Ultrasonic Sensor
Ask students: How do we keep from walking into tables and walls?

1. We have eyes to see where we're going and what's in front of us, but robots do not.
2. However, we can attach sensors to robots to give them more abilities.
3. An ultrasonic sensor acts as the eyes of the robot, and can tell if there is an object in front. 

#####Color Sensor
Ask students: What type of sensor would help the robot stay within the lines of the sumo mat?

# If/else Conditionals

####Learning Goals

#####If/else Conditionals
Students will use if/else if conditionals in their code to program specific instructions.
  
Begin by playing a game where students react to different situations based on instructions. For example:

1. Start with an if statement:
```js
if (shirtColor === 'red') {
  patHead()
} 
```
2. Add an else if and an else statement to continue giving instructions to a specific group of students.
```js
if (shirtColor === 'red') {
  patHead()
} else if (shirtColor === 'blue') {
  tapNose()
} else {
  cheeseSmile()
}
```
3. Allow students to interpret the rules on their own and act based on the condition. 

#####Questions
1. Why were the conditionals (if/else if) important for this exercise?
2. What special syntax did you notice in the code?
3. Why do you think there are three equal signs?
4. How do you think you can use conditionals to program your sumo robot?

# If/else Conditionals

####Learning Goals

#####If/else Conditionals
Students will use if/else if conditionals in their code to program specific instructions.
  
Begin by playing a game where students react to different situations based on instructions. For example:

1. Start with an if statement:
```js
if (shirtColor === 'red') {
  patHead()
} 
```
2. Add an else if and an else statement to continue giving instructions to a specific group of students.
```js
if (shirtColor === 'red') {
  patHead()
} else if (shirtColor === 'blue') {
  tapNose()
} else {
  cheeseSmile()
}
```

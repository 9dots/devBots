# building your robot

*Note to self: build sample attachment base?*

####Learning Goals
Students will use the design thinking method to creatively design their sumo robots.

####Explore
1. Show students a sumo wrestling robot with many attachments and bells and whistles. Looks really cool, huh? 
2. Now, remove all the attachments from the robot and ask students to rebuild it.
3. Set timer for 3 minutes.

####Questions
1. How many students were able to rebuild the robot in 3 minutes?
2. What difficulties did you encounter in rebuilding the robot?
3. What could have made your experience easier?

####Explain
1. Students will design a sumo wrestling robot. 
2. Before building, students will go through the design thinking process to think creatively and systematically about building the best robot. 
3. The three most important aspects you should consider are: defense, offense, and simple attachments. 
  + defense - your robot should be able to defend itself from attacking robots
  + offense - effectively knock over, wedge, or push opponent off sumo mat
  + simple attachments - clip attachments on and off in less than 3 minutes.

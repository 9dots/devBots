# defining functions

####Learning Goals
#####Deep Dive Into Functions

**Explore**
Students will create functions to complete a maze. The goal is to complete in the maze in the fewest lines of code. 

(Create staircase maze)

1. Have students complete maze with their robots.
2. Ask:
  + How many lines of code have you written?
  + Were there any steps that got repeated?
  + What can we do to lessen the number of lines of code?


**Explain**
1. Students can create functions for their repeating steps. 
2. A function is a reusable set of instructions so this will help students shorten their code.
3. 

 
Students should save code as 'defining functions'. (This code should be separate from their sumo code). 
 
 
 
 Students will sumo wrestle using the functions they have created. 
 
 Difficult - how can we simplify?
 Create functions with multiple steps and utilize sensors.

Ultrasonic sensor.
 See: attack, else: turn.
 
 Color sensor.
 See: move forward or backward.

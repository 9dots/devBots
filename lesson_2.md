# defining functions

####Learning Goals
#####Deep Dive Into Functions
Students will create functions to complete a maze. The goal is to write as few lines of code as possible. 


(Create staircase maze)

Go through maze with students. 
Ask: Do you notice any steps that get repeated?
What can we do to lessen the number of lines of code?
 
Students should save code as 'defining functions'. (This code should be separate from their sumo code). 
 
 
 
 Students will sumo wrestle using the functions they have created. 
 
 Difficult - how can we simplify?
 Create functions with multiple steps and utilize sensors.

Ultrasonic sensor.
 See: attack, else: turn.
 
 Color sensor.
 See: move forward or backward.

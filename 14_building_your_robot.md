# 1.4 building your robot

*Note to self: build sample attachment base?*

####Learning Goals
Students will use the design thinking method to creatively design their maze robots.

####Explore
1. Show students a maze robot with the ultrasonic sensor. Looks really cool, huh? 
2. Now, remove all the attachments from the robot and ask students to rebuild it.
3. Set timer for 3 minutes.

####Questions
1. How many students were able to rebuild the robot in 3 minutes?
2. What difficulties did you encounter in rebuilding the robot?
3. What could have made your experience easier?

####Explain
1. Students will design a maze robot. 
2. Before building, students will go through the design thinking process to think creatively and systematically about building the best robot. 
3. Some important aspects you should consider are attachment placement and building simple attachments. 
  + attachment placement - is the ultrasonic sensor facing the right direction?
  + simple attachments - clip attachments on and off in less than 3 minutes.
  + button pusher - does your robot effectively push the 
 
 ####Engage
 Have students work in pairs to build their maze robots. 
 
 ####Justify
 Ask students: What are the various attachments on your robot? What purpose do they serve?

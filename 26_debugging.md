# debugging

#### Learning Goals
Students will work on debugging their sumo robot code and build.

#### Explore
Conduct mini sumo competition using [sumo bracket](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t4xVEncsfBbq83fHIBoCOHBhVogN8YqMmNk5dEdyXPM/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Explain
Students will complete 'working on your code' and 'working on your build' [worksheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t4xVEncsfBbq83fHIBoCOHBhVogN8YqMmNk5dEdyXPM/edit?usp=sharing) to debug any errors on their sumo robot.

**Code Questions**

1. Did your robot find the other robot first?
2. Was your robot able to attack before the other robot saw it?
3. What sensors are on your robot?
4. Do they work properly?
  + If not, what is not working?
5. What is slowing down your group during the competition? Typing? Waiting for ultrasonic sensor to see a robot? Getting stuck in a jam?  

**Build**

1. Did the robots get jammed or tangled?
  + Where did it get jammed?
2. Did your robot get lifted off the ground?
  + If so, which side?
3. Were you able to push or lift the other robot? How?
4. Was the opposing robot able to knock you over? How?
5. Did any of your parts fall off?



#### Engage
Students should talk through the questions with their partner to see what areas of their code and build need improvement.

#### Justify
What changes have the students made in their code and/or build? Why?
